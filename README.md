##  Overview

This project provides an interactive web application to analyze Olympic Games data, focusing on various aspects such as medal tally, overall analysis, country-wise analysis, and athlete-wise analysis. The application is built using Streamlit for the web interface, and leverages Pandas, Plotly, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

---

##  Features

1. Medal Tally: Analyze the medal counts by year and country, with options for viewing overall performance or performance in specific years.
2. Overall Analysis: Examine trends over time for participating nations, events, athletes, and more. Includes visualizations such as line plots and heatmaps.
3. Country-Wise Analysis: Explore detailed medal tallies for specific countries, with visualizations for medal trends over the years and heatmaps of event participation.
4. Athlete-Wise Analysis: Investigate age distributions of athletes by medal type and sport, including distribution plots for different sports.

##  Technologies Used
1. Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web interface.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
3. Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
4. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
5. Matplotlib: For static plots, used in heatmap generation.
